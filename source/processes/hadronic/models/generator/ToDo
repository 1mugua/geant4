5-Nov 98 		   GF	String models need projectile momentum along +z;
				G4VPartonStringModel should do this rotation.
		Nov98           Above is wrong. for the excitation the 
				transformation to the correct frame is done.		
				
5-Nov-98		   GF	G4VPartonStringModel must use momentum corrector
				Do not forget Nucleus in this.
		9-Dec98		Done. Nucleon momenta are included by correcting 
				to sum of strings; these were checked to conserve 
				E/p. 		

30-Oct			   GF	dtor of G4VPartonStringModel should delete things;
				Or should derived classes actually do this?
