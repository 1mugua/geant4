     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            ExampleN07
                            ---------

This directory contains a GEANT4 example on how to create, fill,
print and save histograms in a OODBMS.

The main program "exampleN07.cc" is a standard G4 main (no initialization
of OODBMS or histos).

The run actions are overloaded:

- in BeginOfRunAction the federated data base and the data bases sessions
  are initialized and a transaction is opened;
  1d and 2d histograms are constructed;
  The name of the base name is "ExN07DB".
 
- in EndOfRunAction contents of the histograms are printed and
  the transaction is closed;

The stepping action is overloaded:

- in SteppingAction two histograms are accessed and filled.

The followings are the instruction to execute it for the case of HP-AFS.
