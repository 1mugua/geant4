                              readDB
                              ------

This short program demonstrates how to access events and their
associations which are stored in the database.

To create and populate the database, see the file PersistentEx02/README.  

For the setup of readDB, see PersistentEx01/readDB/README.

The difference between PersistentEx01/readDB and this example
is the additional capability to look into the user derived
persistent hits.
