December 4 1998
- The problems below are solved.
	- GAG (Java, Tcl/Tk) are protected against G4 binary with G4UIsession 
	- GAG has a simple interface to cin (@@Ask protocol).
		More sophisticated interactivity will be added, if required.

- to accept GEANT4 executables which have been compiled with G4UIsession
  session instance. (batch and G4UIGAG sessions are OK)
- to handle GEANT4's "cin" during its execution in a "canonical" way.
  Currently it is accepted bu @@Ask protocol, in exampleN02. 
- better treatment of path of macro files, specially in case of 
	nested macro files
- slowness of JAVA GAG
- adaptation to the coming JDK1.2

Apr 15, 98
-  With the current UI scheme, when two condition described below holds
   for some parameter, then the current value is used instead of the
   default value.
     (i) the currentAsDefault flag is set for a parameter
     (ii) a default value is not given for that parameter
  On the other hand, GAG is designed to display the default value 
  when the "parameter input window" is displayed for the first time.
  The small bug described here is that GAG does not handle
  the special case of CurrentAsDefault described above.
  This bug will be fixed before the next tag.
