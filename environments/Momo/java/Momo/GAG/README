	Improve look-and-feel of GAG by KOdama (as of 31/March/1998).


Swing-1.0.1 is used.
Swing-1.0.2 is desirable, but wait a moment. Swing-1.0.2 has
not yet frozen classes and interfaces, among them JColorChooser
and JFileChooser.
They are left as before in swing.preview package!!


Swing-1.0.2 JFileChooser is good for us since it allows file filtering,
 free label on buttons etc..

But it is better to wait JDK1.2!!


So there is only minor improvements.

Font is one of the most iportant improvement.
Current fonts are too small or not beautiful.
