1998 July 6	JAVA GAG for Beta-01 release

		H. Yoshida; Naruto UE

This directory and its subdirectories contain all necessary JAVA
source codes as well as *.class files. All are archived into
GAG.jar file.

JAVA GAG uses Swing-1.0.2. Older versions based on Swing-1.0.1 can't
be compiled, and pour out "deprecated" errors on javac. 

But Swing-1.0.2 has yet unfrozen classes and interfaces, among them 
are JColorChooser and JFileChooser which JAVA GAG uses.

They are left as before in swing.preview package!!
Swing-1.0.3 is announced, but we will wait JDK1.2 which
is forseen in the next September (right?).
