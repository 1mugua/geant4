	- Add "New Shell" button
	- Add "Continue" button
	- example .Momoext and .Momorc files included in the repository

--5 July 1998

	- All relevant file contains a line including "Beta-01"
	- Unnecessary files removed.
	- Tcl/Tk GGE is left as it was, though its development has been
		stopped. See GGE/README file.

--16 Apr 1998

	Momo and GAG(Geant4 Adaptive GUI) are developed under tcl8.0, tk8.0. 
	The older versions (Tcl7.6/Tk7.4 etc.) are no longer supported.

	Momo.tcl which can invoke both Java and Tcl/Tk GAG is now obsolete.
	tMomo.tcl is a pure Tcl/Tk version which invokes only Tcl/Tk scripts.

A) How to invoke.

		%wish8.0 ~/Momo/tcltk/tMomo.tcl 

	The older version of wish 7.4 can be used.

	The version of wish to invoke  ~/Momo/tcltk/GAG/GAG.tcl and 
	~/Momo/tcltk/GGE/GGE.tcl from ~/Momo/tcltk/tMomo.tcl is the same 
	as that used to invoke ~/Momo/tcltk/Momo.tcl.


B) Environmental variable  MOMOPATH

	This variable is used to specify the directory to which tMomo.tcl 
	refers. If not setenved, users home directory becomes the MOMOPATH.
	MOMOHOME is no longer valid.



C) Save working environments

	The following working environments of Momo are saved automatically 
	in a file .Momorc under the user's home directory, when Momo is 
	terminated normally. .Momorc is automatically used at the next 
	invocation.

	If the file .Momorc is deleted, the default values are used.



D) Extensions/Plug-ins

	You can use any plug-ins by writing a file  .Momoext under the 
	home directory. This allows you to extend Momo's function as you like.


	Momo/tcltk/tMomo.tcl analyses commands in .Momoext and creates menu 
	buttons "Extension". The extended commands are registered to Extension
	as menu buttons and can be invoked upon mouse clicks.

   Rule to write .Momoext)
	1) a command per line
	2) a line starting with "#" is a comment line
	3) the reserved command "Momoseparator" creates a separator in the munu

	See an example  ~/Momo/tcltk/.Momoext for further details.
