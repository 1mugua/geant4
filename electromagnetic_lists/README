                      Electromagnetic PhysicsList
                      ---------------------------
 
     The example of physics list for standard electromagnetic physics 
     package is presented in the subdirectory

     electromagnetic_lists/standard

     The corresponding files are PhysicsList.cc, .hh
     Physics list is equipped by the messenger, which allows to set
     cuts and to define modules of physics to be used. 
     The following modules can be activated:

     1. "standard"    - (alternative) standard EM physics (current version)
     2. "g4v52"       - (alternative) standard EM physics (version G4 5.2p02)
     3. "high_energy" - add high energy processes

     To activate a specific module the UI command can be used:
     "/testem/phys/addPhysics  title"
     By default "standard" module is loaded.

     The PhysicsList options can be defined via G4EmProcessOptions
     class, the example of the usage is in the PhysicsList class

     It is NOT assumed that files from this subdirectory will be
     compiled directly. User can copy or link these files to 
     his/her application, to modify this example according to the
     particular application. It is assumed that user will add modules
     to this PhysicsList.

     This PhysicsList approach is used in tests of the standard 
     electromagnetic package. Similar PhysicsLists can be found out
     in advance examples.

     The direct test of this PhysicsList is performed in the example 
     examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm2
